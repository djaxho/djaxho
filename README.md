## Synopsis

This is just my personal website built in [react](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [react-router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router), and [foundation css](http://foundation.zurb.com/). 

## Installation

If you want to try it out, perhaps for some examples of react and react-router usage, Clone the repo, **npm install**, then **'npm start'** to run a reload server, then when you want to built a production version run **'npm run build'**

## License

Feel free to use it for whatever you want :)
